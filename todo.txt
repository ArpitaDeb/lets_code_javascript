- multiple servers
- responsive design
- accessibility
- polish
  - clear button retains focus when drawing (IE8, 9, Chrome)
  - drawing glitches occur when exiting drawing area that is flush against side of browser
  - one-pixel gap on right side of drawing area (Firefox, others unknown)
  - favicon
	- 'clear' button flashes rather than depressing (iOS)
	- 'clear' button depresses diagonally rather than vertically (IE 9, IE 11)
- multiple painting/erasing tools
- save the pages (persistence / databases)
- wiki-fy the pages
- more complex painting?
- more collaborative features?

User Stories to finish current MMF:
* time out inactive users (make their pointers disappear)
- reconnect and resync when client is disconnected/reconnected
- show disconnection warning / other UX when client is disconnected
- handle server reset smoothly (clear the drawing? re-sync to browsers? not persistence/DB)
- handle packet loss (What packet loss is possible? TCP handles this? What about unstable cellular connections?)
	- at least handle glitches in Socket.IO where we don't receive a message

- version synchronization across client/server
- collision-handling / conflicts / race conditions
- load management
- server monitoring / error handling
- security (handling bad data, denial of service attacks)
	- nsp, snyk
- performance optimization
	- garbage collection pauses
	- network tick rate is currently unbounded
	- event repo stores everything, no culling
- bug: shows ghost pointer on other clients when tapping 'clear' button on mobile browsers
	- see onTouchClick_spike branch (but note document.elementFromPoint may not be testable on IE 11)
	- retire support for IE 11 first?
- bug: ghost pointers block other actions
	- e.g., starting a drag on top of a ghost pointer drags the pointer instead of drawing a line
	- e.g., clicking clear button if ghost pointer is in the way prevents button from clicking
	- investigate 'pointer-events: none' CSS
- polish: make 'clear' button depress when clear event received?

Engineering Tasks:
* When the user becomes active again, even if they don't move their mouse pointer, cause ghost pointer to reappear (e.g., if they click the mouse without moving it)

To Do on current task:
